&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of undebatable benefits of conducting such meetings. The
exact implementation would vary depends on the company culture, and, more
generally, company structure, but a general concept would be the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does wonders for employee’s retention. It’s because of higher job
satisfaction and wiser application of employee’s skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better responsibilities assignment, which effectively influences productivity.
Achieved by careful listening and skillful job delegation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to conduct a regular health check of the team members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The convenient way to instill a set of values which a company strives to commend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, but how on earth 1on1s are supposed to help me with employee retention,
work assignment and all the mentioned benefits that, pardon me, sounds like a
cliché? Keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reasons for 1on1s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole idea of the 1on1 meetings is based on a couple of good practices in
running an effective organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, everybody needs feedback to grow and improve, and your
organization is not an exception — to improve the processes you want feedback
too. Who can provide one? Those who experience any inconvenience, because their
daily-used tools and procedures don’t help them succeed. Those are obstacles on
their way to succeeding, and the key here is to get that information bottom-top
and have those “process organizers” deal with them. The same works for any kind
of feedback you might get from them since the chances are you work among highly
intelligent people and it would be a shame not to benefit from that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Happy people work better&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anybody dare to argue with? If no, okay then let’s move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, let’s spend there a minute. Probably most you have mostly worked with highly
motivated self- starters who strive to achieve and improve, it’s pretty common
and desired profile in a technology company. But let’s face the truth,
everybody’s enthusiasm falters one day, and, well, not everybody is so highly
committed anyway. What’s then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the sooner a manager or a company gets to know about that, the better the
situation might be handled. Not only will an employee be more satisfied, but
also the brand of the company will get stronger on the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To acquire such information you need to first listen to what somebody has to say
and even elicit a discussion that may potentially prompt them to reveal their
true concerns and desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Commitment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not always possible to make people happy by doing what they want, on
contrary, it’s more common that leaders have to decide for them. It’s not
uncommon that startup’s don’t have enough resources to provide employees with
whatever they want or whatever labor market dictates. And even if you have
enough resources you might end up with hires who are swayed by incentives, and
no sooner the more attractive benefit or financial-wise job appears on the
horizon, will they simply change the job, leaving you behind. Instead of
motivating them you should try to inspire them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you may wonder how 1on1s might actually help here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it depends how creative you are since it is a great place to convey
whatever message you would like to. While it might take a lot of courage to
express your ideas in public you might find it more comfortable to do it
face-to-face. Moreover, it’s applicable to employees as well, some of them would
prefer to have a more in-depth discussion around some topics while another one
would rather prefer to skim through the topics and quickly get through a lot of
them, than dig somewhat deeper. So even though you might have already announced
something publicly to the company or team, you probably have just skimmed
through the topics, slightly touching them but not getting into intricate
details which the part of the team might have expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, commitment is not something that you can buy it’s rather something
that you have to earn. The onus here is on a leader.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[One-On-One Meetings part 1, What]]></title><description><![CDATA[A 1on1, or one on one meeting is a basic, yet a crucial tool to facilitate

communication in your organization. It is achieved by regular, set up,
face-to-face meetings that usually last between 30 to 90 minutes each and even
though virtually anybody can set a one with anybody, we’ll focus on the one
between leaders and those who are being led. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is a 1on1 meeting and what is not&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each meeting may or may not have an agenda, though it should be stated
beforehand what kind of topics are preferable.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Topics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the list of possible topics may become as long as my arm and depends on a
particular project or company, the list of undesirable ones is quite short and
is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues discussed while daily meetings in a group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues normally discussed during retrospective or similar meetings if applicable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implementation or technical details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rumors*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems hard and fast, but the reality is that it might be okay to discuss these
topics if they affect interlocutors. Some would argue that the list should
include „rumors” of any kind, but on contrary, I can imagine a set of examples
where a 1on1 meeting might be actually a perfect place to discuss them alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;*Special case: rumors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might happen that gossip comes up during a meeting, whether as the effect of
piping up or a deliberate maneuver. If it has already come up, then it ought to
be addressed. Moreover, if need be, let’s explicitly bring them up over the
course of a meeting to juxtapose them with facts and clean the air. These are
just examples of topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slanderous gossips, if one of you feel the urge to discuss them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gossips about employees leaving the company in bulk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;misleading rumors around a strategy of a company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being stated, what kind of rumors should be omitted? Well, it depends
heavily on the reason behind mentioning them in the first place. There are
individuals who take a great deal of pleasure from gossiping, especially if they
happen to be in the face to face situation when nobody else listens to. So,
unfortunately, 1on1s are great for those who take sheer pleasure from gossiping.
I definitely encourage you to steer clear of it and to sort it out as soon as
you notice by weeding out a topic and replacing it with a valuable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who should be running them and why it should be a team leader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular fallacy is that 1on1 is a mundane task to be  done by HR people and
in fact, there is at least one reason to think so, namely the identification of
flight risks among staff. While such issues may well be topics for 1on1 they are
merely the beginning and our definition of 1on1 should be extended by far more
items including measuring job satisfaction, discussing obstacles, clarifying the
mission of the project or explaining recent decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why having a team
leader or a manager to run those meeting is what is generally desired. It
demands a wider perspective, closer relationship and a piece of comprehensive
knowledge about one’s environment to run a valuable discussion that could end up
with actionable points.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello!]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the first blog post here, I just wanted to say hello and put there some information about me.
