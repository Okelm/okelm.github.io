If it has already come up, then it ought to\nbe addressed. Moreover, if need be, let’s explicitly bring it up over the\ncourse of the meeting to juxtapose the rumors with facts and clean the air. These are\njust examples of topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slanderous gossip, if anyone feels the urge to discuss such issues</li>\n<li>gossip about employees leaving the company in bulk</li>\n<li>misleading rumors related to a company’s strategy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having said that, what kind of rumors should be omitted? Well, it depends\nheavily on the reason behind mentioning them in the first place. There are\nindividuals who take a great deal of pleasure in gossiping, especially if they\nhappen to be in a face-to-face situation when nobody else is listening. So,\nunfortunately, 1on1s are great for those who take sheer pleasure from gossiping.\nI definitely encourage you to steer clear of it and to sort these types of issues out as soon as\nthey come up by weeding out a topic and replacing it with a valuable one.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"who-should-be-running-them-and-why-it-should-be-the-team-leader\"><a href=\"#who-should-be-running-them-and-why-it-should-be-the-team-leader\" aria-label=\"who should be running them and why it should be the team leader permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Who should be running them and why it should be the team leader</h3>\n<p>A popular fallacy is that 1on1s are a mundane task to be  done by HR people and\nin fact, there is at least one reason to think so, namely the identification of\nflight risks among staff. While such issues may well be topics for 1on1 meetings they are\nmerely the beginning and our definition of the 1on1 should be extended by many more\nitems including: measuring job satisfaction, discussing obstacles, clarifying the\nmission of the project or explaining recent decisions. </p>\n<p>That’s why having a team\nleader or a manager to run those meetings is what is generally desired. It\ndemands a wider perspective, closer relationship with the staff and a piece of comprehensive\nknowledge about one’s environment to run a valuable discussion that could result in actionable points.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"1on1s part 1, What","date":"March 01, 2019","description":"What is a 1on1 meeting, what to discuss and what to avoid?
