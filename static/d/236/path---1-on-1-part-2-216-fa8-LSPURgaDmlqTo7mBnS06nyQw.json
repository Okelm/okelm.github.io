The\nexact implementation would vary depends on the company culture, and, more\ngenerally, company structure, but a general concept would be the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It does wonders for employee’s retention. It’s because of higher job\nsatisfaction and wiser application of employee’s skills</li>\n<li>Better responsibilities assignment, which effectively influences productivity.\nAchieved by careful listening and skillful job delegation</li>\n<li>A way to conduct a regular health check of the team members</li>\n<li>The convenient way to instill a set of values which a company strives to commend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wait, but how on earth 1on1s are supposed to help me with employee retention,\nwork assignment and all the mentioned benefits that, pardon me, sounds like a\ncliché?

Who can provide one? Those who experience any inconvenience, because their\ndaily-used tools and procedures don’t help them succeed. Those are obstacles on\ntheir way to succeeding, and the key here is to get that information bottom-top\nand have those “process organizers” deal with them. The same works for any kind\nof feedback you might get from them since the chances are you work among highly\nintelligent people and it would be a shame not to benefit from that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./OneOnOne2.jpeg\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"happy-people-work-better\"><a href=\"#happy-people-work-better\" aria-label=\"happy people work better permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"21\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Happy people work better</h4>\n<p>Does anybody dare to argue with? If no, okay then let’s move forward.</p>\n<p>Or, let’s spend there a minute. Probably most you have mostly worked with highly\nmotivated self- starters who strive to achieve and improve, it’s pretty common\nand desired profile in a technology company. But let’s face the truth,\neverybody’s enthusiasm falters one day, and, well, not everybody is so highly\ncommitted anyway. What’s then?</p>\n<p>Then, the sooner a manager or a company gets to know about that, the better the\nsituation might be handled. Not only will an employee be more satisfied, but\nalso the brand of the company will get stronger on the labor market.</p>\n<p>To acquire such information you need to first listen to what somebody has to say\nand even elicit a discussion that may potentially prompt them to reveal their\ntrue concerns and desires.</p>\n<h4 id=\"commitment\"><a href=\"#commitment\" aria-label=\"commitment permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"21\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Commitment</h4>\n<p>It’s not always possible to make people happy by doing what they want, on\ncontrary, it’s more common that leaders have to decide for them. It’s not\nuncommon that startup’s don’t have enough resources to provide employees with\nwhatever they want or whatever labor market dictates. And even if you have\nenough resources you might end up with hires who are swayed by incentives, and\nno sooner the more attractive benefit or financial-wise job appears on the\nhorizon, will they simply change the job, leaving you behind. Instead of\nmotivating them you should try to inspire them.</p>\n<p>So you may wonder how 1on1s might actually help here?</p>\n<p>Well, it depends how creative you are since it is a great place to convey\nwhatever message you would like to. While it might take a lot of courage to\nexpress your ideas in public you might find it more comfortable to do it\nface-to-face. Moreover, it’s applicable to employees as well, some of them would\nprefer to have a more in-depth discussion around some topics while another one\nwould rather prefer to skim through the topics and quickly get through a lot of\nthem, than dig somewhat deeper. So even though you might have already announced\nsomething publicly to the company or team, you probably have just skimmed\nthrough the topics, slightly touching them but not getting into intricate\ndetails which the part of the team might have expected.</p>\n<p>To sum up, commitment is not something that you can buy it’s rather something\nthat you have to earn. The onus here is on a leader.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"1on1s part 2, Why to run it?","date":"March 05, 2019","description":"This time the focus is on why should we even bother running meetings like that.
