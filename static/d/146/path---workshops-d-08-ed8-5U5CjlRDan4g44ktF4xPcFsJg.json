Simply the\nkind of what shop were one deweloper presents i to pick and other developers Are\nthen challenged. Besides there’s one developer there are also other developers\nwho act as mentors for participants. It happened that I was invited to be a\nmentor for the workshop on react native. </p>\n<h4 id=\"what-theyve-learned\"><a href=\"#what-theyve-learned\" aria-label=\"what theyve learned permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What They’ve learned</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Expo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s very convienient tool to use especially on such occasion, when you have a\ncouple of hours to present the most important stuff regarding a topic and you\ndon’t want to waste it for configuration. It allows to setup from zero to\nrunning app on a device in minutes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Props, state</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The basics of React are all about these too. Props allow to compose components\nby sending from parents to children and state gives components ability to\ncontrol encapsulated data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forms and AsyncStorage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forms are bread nad butter of every frontend developer so it makes sense to\npresent the idomatic way of writing them in React Native. This was the place\nwhere we used the power of state for the purpose of saving inputs on each\nkeystroke and then push it to AsyncStorage on form submit.</p>\n<p>AsyncStorage is not the perfect solution for this case, yet the API is pretty\nstraight forward and gives a lot of functionalities without much boilerplate.</p>\n<h4 id=\"for-web-developers-who-want-to-try-rn\"><a href=\"#for-web-developers-who-want-to-try-rn\" aria-label=\"for web developers who want to try rn permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>For web developers who want to try RN</h4>\n<p>Some React devs are a bit scared of starting using React Native and they ask questions whether it’s hard and what are the differences. </p>\n<p>React Native -> React\nWell I can only say from my experience that moving from React Native to React was pretty seamless. Some stuff like hot reloading are based on web solutions, and they are not perfect though.</p>\n<p>React -> React Native\nSo when I got back from React project to React Native project again It struck me how much more hassle to get it all working. Not to mention the deployment process.\nThe one difference that everybody notices at once is that in lieu of divs you are presented with View.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight has-highlighted-lines\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">React</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n<span class=\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\">    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">className</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>classes<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>container<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\"></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">        Web devs comfort zone</span>\n<span class=\"token plain-text\">    </span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight has-highlighted-lines\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">ReactNative</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n<span class=\"gatsby-highlight-code-line\">    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>View</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">style</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>styles<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>container<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\"></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">        Web devs feels apprehensive</span>\n<span class=\"token plain-text\">    </span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>View</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The other one is that there are no CSS as you know them from web. There are style properties instead,\nwhich you can then compose and you use camelCase to write them.</p>\n<p>KOD</p>\n<p>If writing properties in camel case is too exotic for you, let’s try with styled-components, which allows you to write them in your favourite way:</p>\n<p>KOD</p>\n<p>SessionStorage? LocalStorage? Well, both are part of Web Api, so they are not available in React Native :(\nbut hey, you have access to something like AsyncStorage which in fact works similiarly to LocalStorage but\nhas a set of additional convenience methods, and all of them return Promise.</p>\n<p>KOD\nRouting? So the most common lib for Navigation through an app, allows you to set up routing as you would do it on web.\nSet of screens that you access via navigation to an established route. Yet there is at least one difference,\ncheck if you can find it: </p>\n<p>KOD\nHave you spotted it? No links in the routes, string based on the name of component instead.\nIt’s simply because urls are not how you navigate through native apps. You can, however,\nuse deep links to couple a url to the particular views. This functionality is used rather to navigate to the screen from outside the app,\nnot to redirect to other screen when you are already in the app though.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-ive-noticed\"><a href=\"#what-ive-noticed\" aria-label=\"what ive noticed permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What I’ve noticed</h4>\n<p>Pair programming is effective </p>\n<p>How many things you can do when you are passionate and curious</p>\n<p>How many things I thought I knew before I’d been asked to explain it in detail</p>\n<br> \n<br> ","frontmatter":{"title":"Workshops","date":"March 01, 2019","description":"Running workshops"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Workshops/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/1on1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"One-On-One Meetings part 1, What"}}}}
