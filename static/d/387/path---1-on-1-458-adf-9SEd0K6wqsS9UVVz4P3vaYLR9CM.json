It is achieved by regular, set up,\nface-to-face meetings that usually last between 30 to 90 minutes each and even\nthough virtually anybody can set a one with anybody, we’ll focus on the one\nbetween leaders and those who are being led. </p>\n<h3>What is a 1on1 meeting and what is not</h3>\n<p>Each meeting may or may not have an agenda, though it should be stated\nbeforehand what kind of topics are preferable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cj3KKM7uKVowg-OuO8Wk5w.jpeg\"></p>\n<h4>Topics</h4>\n<p>While the list of possible topics may become as long as my arm and depends on a\nparticular project or company, the list of undesirable ones is quite short and\nis as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>issues discussed while daily meetings in a group</li>\n<li>issues normally discussed during retrospective or similar meetings if applicable</li>\n<li>implementation or technical details</li>\n<li>rumors*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seems hard and fast, but the reality is that it might be okay to discuss these\ntopics if they affect interlocutors. Some would argue that the list should\ninclude „rumors” of any kind, but on contrary, I can imagine a set of examples\nwhere a 1on1 meeting might be actually a perfect place to discuss them alike.</p>\n<h4>*Special case: rumors</h4>\n<p>It might happen that gossip comes up during a meeting, whether as the effect of\npiping up or a deliberate maneuver. If it has already come up, then it ought to\nbe addressed. Moreover, if need be, let’s explicitly bring them up over the\ncourse of a meeting to juxtapose them with facts and clean the air. These are\njust examples of topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slanderous gossips, if one of you feel the urge to discuss them</li>\n<li>gossips about employees leaving the company in bulk</li>\n<li>misleading rumors around a strategy of a company</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With that being stated, what kind of rumors should be omitted? Well, it depends\nheavily on the reason behind mentioning them in the first place. There are\nindividuals who take a great deal of pleasure from gossiping, especially if they\nhappen to be in the face to face situation when nobody else listens to. So,\nunfortunately, 1on1s are great for those who take sheer pleasure from gossiping.\nI definitely encourage you to steer clear of it and to sort it out as soon as\nyou notice by weeding out a topic and replacing it with a valuable one.</p>\n<h3>Who should be running them and why it should be a team leader</h3>\n<p>The popular fallacy is that 1on1 is a mundane task to be  done by HR people and\nin fact, there is at least one reason to think so, namely the identification of\nflight risks among staff. While such issues may well be topics for 1on1 they are\nmerely the beginning and our definition of 1on1 should be extended by far more\nitems including measuring job satisfaction, discussing obstacles, clarifying the\nmission of the project or explaining recent decisions. That’s why having a team\nleader or a manager to run those meeting is what is generally desired. It\ndemands a wider perspective, closer relationship and a piece of comprehensive\nknowledge about one’s environment to run a valuable discussion that could end up\nwith actionable points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*f9w6xiZQFleeNTvKdIitqw.jpeg\"></p>\n<h3>Benefits for a company</h3>\n<p>There are a couple of undebatable benefits of conducting such meetings. The\nexact implementation would vary depends on the company culture, and, more\ngenerally, company structure, but a general concept would be the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It does wonders for employee’s retention. It’s because of higher job\nsatisfaction and wiser application of employee’s skills</li>\n<li>Better responsibilities assignment, which effectively influences productivity.\nAchieved by careful listening and skillful job delegation</li>\n<li>A way to conduct a regular health check of the team members</li>\n<li>The convenient way to instill a set of values which a company strives to commend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wait, but how on earth 1on1s are supposed to help me with employee retention,\nwork assignment and all the mentioned benefits that, pardon me, sounds like a\ncliché? Keep reading.</p>\n<h3>Reasons for 1on1s</h3>\n<p>The whole idea of the 1on1 meetings is based on a couple of good practices in\nrunning an effective organization.</p>\n<h4>Feedback</h4>\n<p>On the whole, everybody needs feedback to grow and improve, and your\norganization is not an exception — to improve the processes you want feedback\ntoo. Who can provide one? Those who experience any inconvenience, because their\ndaily-used tools and procedures don’t help them succeed. Those are obstacles on\ntheir way to succeeding, and the key here is to get that information bottom-top\nand have those “process organizers” deal with them. The same works for any kind\nof feedback you might get from them since the chances are you work among highly\nintelligent people and it would be a shame not to benefit from that.</p>\n<h4>Happy people work better</h4>\n<p>Does anybody dare to argue with? If no, okay then let’s move forward.</p>\n<p>Or, let’s spend there a minute. Probably most you have mostly worked with highly\nmotivated self- starters who strive to achieve and improve, it’s pretty common\nand desired profile in a technology company. But let’s face the truth,\neverybody’s enthusiasm falters one day, and, well, not everybody is so highly\ncommitted anyway. What’s then?</p>\n<p>Then, the sooner a manager or a company gets to know about that, the better the\nsituation might be handled. Not only will an employee be more satisfied, but\nalso the brand of the company will get stronger on the labor market.</p>\n<p>To acquire such information you need to first listen to what somebody has to say\nand even elicit a discussion that may potentially prompt them to reveal their\ntrue concerns and desires.</p>\n<h4>Commitment</h4>\n<p>It’s not always possible to make people happy by doing what they want, on\ncontrary, it’s more common that leaders have to decide for them. It’s not\nuncommon that startup’s don’t have enough resources to provide employees with\nwhatever they want or whatever labor market dictates. And even if you have\nenough resources you might end up with hires who are swayed by incentives, and\nno sooner the more attractive benefit or financial-wise job appears on the\nhorizon, will they simply change the job, leaving you behind. Instead of\nmotivating them you should try to inspire them.</p>\n<p>So you may wonder how 1on1s might actually help here?</p>\n<p>Well, it depends how creative you are since it is a great place to convey\nwhatever message you would like to. While it might take a lot of courage to\nexpress your ideas in public you might find it more comfortable to do it\nface-to-face. Moreover, it’s applicable to employees as well, some of them would\nprefer to have a more in-depth discussion around some topics while another one\nwould rather prefer to skim through the topics and quickly get through a lot of\nthem, than dig somewhat deeper. So even though you might have already announced\nsomething publicly to the company or team, you probably have just skimmed\nthrough the topics, slightly touching them but not getting into intricate\ndetails which the part of the team might have expected.</p>\n<p>To sum up, commitment is not something that you can buy it’s rather something\nthat you have to earn. The onus here is on a leader.</p>\n<h4>In progress (Mentoring antagonists</h4>\n<p>Some people are inherently rebellious)</p>\n<h3>A piece of advice</h3>\n<h4>For leaders</h4>\n<p>Introducing one on one meetings is rather an evolutionary process than a\nrevolution. It takes some time to make people comfortable and gain their\ninvolvement. When you first invite somebody to a meeting, the message should be\nclear — it’s for us to talk. And the first meeting should be exactly as that.</p>\n<p>You may say that it’s easier to say than do. Well, while it’s definitely easier\nto introduce the meetings when you have just joined a new team and everything\naround you is fresh, it might be terribly hard for those who have already built\na relationship with people, and now wants to introduce a mysterious new thing.\nIt’s up to them whether the benefits outweigh the loses, yet this post strongly\nencourages to place a great deal of importance on face-to-face relationships.</p>\n<h4>For those who were invited</h4>\n<p>Calm down. If you get an invitation your career is probably on the verge of\ngetting better, short of you have been conspicuously sloppy, aggressive or\nobnoxious in any way. </p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>To summarize, even though it takes some doing it’s worth devoting your time to\nintroduce the convention of running one on one meetings regularly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leaders are responsible for running then, not HR people,</li>\n<li>It’s not a place to discuss an issue which should be addressed through public\nchannels,</li>\n<li>There are at least three main reasons why to run the meetings. The one is that\nis that is if you know for receiving feedback from people. The second is it’s a\nway for leaders to provide mentorship. The third it’s a convenient way to\nidentify employees problems,</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even though I mainly draw on my own experience, my knowledge is based on\nresources that I strongly recommend:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205\">The Hard Thing About Hard\nThings</a>\nby Ben Horowitz</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Managing-Talent-Networked-Age/dp/1625275773\">The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked\nAge</a>\nby Reid Hoffman</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897\">The Manager’s\nPath</a>\nby Camille Fournier</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250183863/\">Extreme\nOwnership</a>\nby Jocko Willink and Leif Babin</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.moznainaczej.com.pl/Download/DoktrynaJakosci/DoktrynaJako%C5%9Bci_wydanie_II.pdf\">Doktryna Jakości: Rzecz o skutecznym\nzarządzaniu</a>\nby Andrzej Blikle</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"One-On-One Meetings","date":"March 01, 2019","description":"What is a 1-on-1 meeting, what to discuss and what not, why it is run, what are the benefits, and who should be running them"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/1on1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello!"}},"next":null}}
