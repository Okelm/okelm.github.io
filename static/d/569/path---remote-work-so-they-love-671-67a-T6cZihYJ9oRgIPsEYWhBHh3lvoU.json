Nothing replaces\nthe face to face interaction, but on the other hand the engineers usually don’t\nenjoy working in groups side by side and so its not always a bad thing. Anyway,\nthere are a couple of things we can do address the communication overhead.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Invest in top quality communication tools</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Spend $149 and buy a good microphone like<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Silver/dp/B002VA464S\"> Blue\nYeti</a>. You\nwill be heard clearly and loudly. </p>\n<p>Spend $125 on a <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c930e-webcam\">webcam</a>. </p>\n<p>At this point you have a good setup for being heard and seen.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Be on time on meetings</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Being late on meetings is disrespecful. You want to be a couple of minutes\nbefore a meeting starts, yet it  really depends on the company culture what “on\ntime” means, but before you learn it, it’s better to simply stick to that rule. </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Async communication is great, but don’t overestimate it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While most of the communication will be done via asynchronous channels,\nsometimes it’s worth jumping on a call and discuss an issue without the need to\nwrite and read again and again. If you’re worried that you will lose the benefit\nof having the conversation written down somewhere — no worries you can record\nthe dialog!</p>\n<h4 id=\"encourage-the-team-to-record-meetings\"><a href=\"#encourage-the-team-to-record-meetings\" aria-label=\"encourage the team to record meetings permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Encourage the team to record meetings</h4>\n<p>Especially these where somebody gives an intruction or introduction to a new\ntool or shares knowledge. Nobody can memorize the step by step instruction like\nthis: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xh2nnjttOwo\">https://youtu.be/Xh2nnjttOwo</a></p>\n<p>You would rather record it and publish within the company and let people get\nback to it when they are in need. If you work remotely you might be the one how\nwill use it first.</p>\n<h4 id=\"raise-visibility-by-staying-transparent\"><a href=\"#raise-visibility-by-staying-transparent\" aria-label=\"raise visibility by staying transparent permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Raise visibility by staying transparent</h4>\n<p>On the whole, you should try using the tooling provided by the team, it might\nbe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>project management platforms (like Basecamp or Jira)</li>\n<li>source code repos</li>\n<li>communication channels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So in my opinion in most cases you’ll be fine with just using what other team\nmembers use. Some exceptions depend on how your role is different from the most\nroles in the team.</p>\n<p><strong>If you’re the first remote guy in the team</strong>, you should think of being\nproactive in staying visible with what you do. If you get hired as the first\nremote guy ever, you’re definitely an expert and you’re the one who is expected\nto create an effective mean of collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>If you’re not the first one, but your time zone is very different</strong> from the\nrest of the team, and you work mostly in your time zone, you must be causious\nsince the good practices within the team might be enough in your case. You will\ncommunicate mostly async, so you should place a lot of importance on setting\nhigh standard of that async communication. </p>\n<p>Regardless of your situation there is a piece of advice on that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>**Divide and conquer. **if you use a project management tool like Jira, you most\nprobably get tasks on daily basis. Then it’s your role to divide them to smaller\npieces that you can deliver each couple of days.</li>\n<li>You push the code to the shared repo and you want to ask your team members to\npull the changes to the common branch. **Let’s polish that request. ** You can\nadd descriptive information regarding what’s changed. If you work on view\nrelated software you may consider adding a print screen, gif or a short screen\ncasted video (10–60 sec) which explains what you that pull/merge request does</li>\n<li><strong>Commit small pieces,</strong> let commits tell a compelling story of how they\ncontribute to the final effect.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/remote-work-so-they-love/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/react-vs-react-native/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"From React Web to React Native"}},"next":null}}
