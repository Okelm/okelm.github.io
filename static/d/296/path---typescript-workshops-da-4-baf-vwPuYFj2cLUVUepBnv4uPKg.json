It might not be aligned with the engineering culture in some companies though, so don’t panic if somebody looks at you as if you were a weirdo. Be the first one to mention screen sharing and show that you’re open to suggestions. </p>\n<p>You definitely need the right tooling to run an effective session.

Nothing can replace the face to face interaction, but on the other hand engineers usually don’t enjoy working in groups side by side and so it’s not always a bad thing. Anyway, there are a couple of things we can do to address the communication overhead.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Invest in top quality communication tools</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Spend $149 and buy a good microphone like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Silver/dp/B002VA464S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blue Yeti</a>. You will be heard loud and clear, literally and figuratively. </p>\n<p>Spend $125 on a <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c930e-webcam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">webcam</a>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"./mic.jpg\">\nAt this point you have a good setup for being heard and seen.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Be on time to meetings</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Being late to meetings is disrespectful. You want to be there a couple of minutes before the meeting starts, yet it really depends on the company culture what “on time” means, but before you learn it, it’s better to simply stick to that rule. </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Async communication is great, but don’t overestimate it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While most of the communication will be done via asynchronous channels, sometimes it’s worth jumping on a call and discussing an issue without the need to write and read again and again. If you’re worried that you will lose the benefit of having the conversation written down somewhere — no worries, you can record the dialog!</p>\n<h3 id=\"encourage-the-team-to-record-meetings\"><a href=\"#encourage-the-team-to-record-meetings\" aria-label=\"encourage the team to record meetings permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Encourage the team to record meetings</h3>\n<p>Especially those where somebody gives instructions or an introduction to a new tool or shares knowledge. Nobody can memorize step by step <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xh2nnjttOwo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instructions like these</a>. Sure that they become obsolete with time, but it’s better to have them documented anyway.</p>\n<p>It would be more beneficial to record them, publish the material within the company and let people get back to it when they are in need.

Some exceptions depend on how your role is different from most roles in the team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tomj.github.io/2014/09/25/git-interactive-rebasing-aka-rebasin.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://tomj.github.io/images/2014-09-25-git-interactive-rebasing-aka-rebasin/pre_squash.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>If you’re the first remote engineer in the team</strong>, you should think of being proactive in staying visible with what you do. If you get hired as the first remote person ever, you’re definitely an expert and you’re the one who is expected to create an effective means of collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>If you’re not the first one, but your time zone is very different</strong> from the rest of the team, and you work mostly in your time zone, you must be cautious since the good practices within the team might not be enough in your case. You will mostly communicate in an async fashion, so you should place a lot of importance on setting a high standard to raise visibility. </p>\n<p>Regardless of your situation there is a piece of advice on how to achieve this:\n<strong>Divide work into smaller chunks so that you can deliver daily. Describe the job that is done with a descriptive pull/merge request message with video or gifs and by small and self-explanatory commits.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"we-are-all-different\"><a href=\"#we-are-all-different\" aria-label=\"we are all different permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>We are all different</h3>\n<p>It’s a business’s vested interest to hire the most qualified candidates irrespective of differences.

We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are ADA compliant and handicap accessible.</em></p>\n<p>Whether it’s honest and a company is really committed to these values is anybody’s guess, but you should definitely stay fair. </p>\n<p><strong>This is one of the greatest advantages of a highly competitive market.
