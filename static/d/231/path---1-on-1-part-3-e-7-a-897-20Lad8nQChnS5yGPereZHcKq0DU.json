It takes some time to make people comfortable and gain their\ninvolvement. When you first invite somebody to a meeting, the message should be\nclear — it’s for us to talk. And the first meeting should be exactly like that.</p>\n<p>You may say that it’s easier said than done. Well, while it’s definitely easier\nto introduce the meetings when you have just joined a new team and everything\naround you is fresh, it might be terribly hard for those who have already built\na relationship with people, and now want to introduce a mysterious new thing.\nIt’s up to them whether the benefits outweigh the losses, yet this post strongly\nencourages to place a great deal of importance on face-to-face relationships.</p>\n<h4 id=\"for-those-who-were-invited\"><a href=\"#for-those-who-were-invited\" aria-label=\"for those who were invited permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>For those who were invited</h4>\n<p>Calm down.

Some key points to keep in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leaders are responsible for running them, not HR people.</li>\n<li>It’s not a place to discuss an issue which should be addressed through public\nchannels.</li>\n<li>There are at least three main reasons why you should run the meetings. The first one is that you can\nreceive valuable feedback from people. Secondly, it’s a\nway for leaders to provide mentorship. Finally, it’s a convenient way to\nidentify your employees’ problems.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even though I mainly draw on my own experience, my knowledge is also based on\nresources that I strongly recommend:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hard Thing About Hard\nThings</a>\nby Ben Horowitz</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Managing-Talent-Networked-Age/dp/1625275773\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked\nAge</a>\nby Reid Hoffman</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Manager’s\nPath</a>\nby Camille Fournier</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250183863/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extreme\nOwnership</a>\nby Jocko Willink and Leif Babin</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.moznainaczej.com.pl/Download/DoktrynaJakosci/DoktrynaJako%C5%9Bci_wydanie_II.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doktryna Jakości: Rzecz o skutecznym\nzarządzaniu</a>\nby Andrzej Blikle</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"1on1s part 3, Advice","date":"March 13, 2019","description":"When you first invite somebody to a meeting, the message should be clear — it’s for us to talk.
