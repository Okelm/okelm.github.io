From some of them you would expect to receive incredible help from compiler, from others, well, significantly less help and sometimes you might be thinking the language itself is being obnoxios.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cszhu/status/1169859162047574016?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/cszhu/status/1169859162047574016?s=20</a>\nI’m being rude I know, but let’s face the fact: JavaScript leaves a lot to be desired. While we cannot have everything, we can try make the world a better place by being more careful and considering thoroughly the tooling we choose.</p>\n<p>I believe that a good developer experience happens when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>concepts can be expressed in a concise manner without too many boilerplate</li>\n<li>the code is unambigious and expressive</li>\n<li>newcomers are welcomed with self documented code</li>\n<li>the code is focused on data transformation rather than data obfuscation</li>\n<li>a compiler or IDE helps you writes quality code without </li>\n</ul>\n<p>TypeScript is here to help you achieve some of these ^ namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>code becomes less ambigiuos, thanks to having strickly defined types</li>\n<li>code is more self documented which helps newcomers to get into the project, but also to get back after some time and still be albo to understand what is happening</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The thing that I believe make software developmnet in JavaScript better is having strong and static type system. I’ll explain why later on.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"TypeScript","date":"November 22, 2019","description":"Typescript is THE tool"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/typescript-workshops/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/ramda/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ramda vs Vanilla JS"}},"next":null}}
