The\nexact implementation varies depending on the company culture, and, more\ngenerally, company structure, but the general concept would be the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It does wonders for employee retention. This is because of higher job\nsatisfaction and wiser application of employees’ skills</li>\n<li>Better responsibilities assignment, which effectively influences productivity.\nAchieved by careful listening and skillful job delegation</li>\n<li>A way to conduct a regular health check of the team members</li>\n<li>A convenient way to instill a set of values which a company strives to commend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wait, but how on earth are 1on1s supposed to help me with employee retention,\nwork assignment and all the mentioned benefits that, pardon me, sound like a complete\ncliché?

Who can provide it? Those who experience inconvenience because their\neveryday tools and procedures don’t help them succeed. Those are obstacles on\ntheir way to succeeding, and the key here is to get that information from bottom to top\nand have those “process organizers” deal with them. The same is true of any kind\nof feedback you might get from them since the chances are you work among highly\nintelligent people and it would be a shame not to benefit from that.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7379d924b924f38c69ced9d13ccf2da7/30631/OneOnOne2.jpeg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAgX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAdzvZhhOuN//xAAbEAACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADEyEiMf/aAAgBAQABBQIax6l2B2AbBTgn/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQMBAT8BiP/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAECAQE/AVf/xAAbEAACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQACEBIhkf/aAAgBAQAGPwIGmrB9gsuxKcz/AP/EABwQAQACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAIYERMUFRof/aAAgBAQABPyFWRRz6lmL2ywWHiEqBiAtpNk//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAECfP/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECH/2gAIAQMBAT8Qo//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEf/aAAgBAgEBPxDQn//EABsQAQADAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQZHw/9oACAEBAAE/EB5+zgCvb7YzKI3bkKCZaJtIRBgsxACi3upSuHk//9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"OneOnOne2\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/7379d924b924f38c69ced9d13ccf2da7/f8fb9/OneOnOne2.jpeg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7379d924b924f38c69ced9d13ccf2da7/e8976/OneOnOne2.jpeg 148w,\n/static/7379d924b924f38c69ced9d13ccf2da7/63df2/OneOnOne2.jpeg 295w,\n/static/7379d924b924f38c69ced9d13ccf2da7/f8fb9/OneOnOne2.jpeg 590w,\n/static/7379d924b924f38c69ced9d13ccf2da7/85e3d/OneOnOne2.jpeg 885w,\n/static/7379d924b924f38c69ced9d13ccf2da7/d1924/OneOnOne2.jpeg 1180w,\n/static/7379d924b924f38c69ced9d13ccf2da7/30631/OneOnOne2.jpeg 1600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h4 id=\"happy-people-work-better\"><a href=\"#happy-people-work-better\" aria-label=\"happy people work better permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Happy people work better</h4>\n<p>Does anybody dare to argue with that? If no, okay then let’s move forward.</p>\n<p>Or, let’s spend a minute here. There is a good chance that most of you have generally worked with highly\nmotivated self- starters who strive to achieve and improve: it’s pretty common\nand desired profile in a technology company. But let’s face the truth,\neveryone’s enthusiasm is bound to falter at some point, and, well, not everybody is so highly\ncommitted anyway. What then?</p>\n<p>Well, the sooner a manager or a company gets to know about this issue, the better the\nsituation can be handled. Not only will the employee be more satisfied, but\nalso the brand of the company will get stronger on the labor market.</p>\n<p>To acquire such information you need to first listen to what somebody has to say\nand even elicit a discussion that may potentially prompt them to reveal their\ntrue concerns and desires.</p>\n<h4 id=\"commitment\"><a href=\"#commitment\" aria-label=\"commitment permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Commitment</h4>\n<p>It’s not always possible to make people happy by doing what they want. On the\ncontrary, it’s more common that leaders have to decide for them. It’s not\nuncommon that startup’s lack the resources to provide employees with\nwhatever they want or whatever the labor market dictates. And even if you have\nenough resources you might end up with hires who are swayed by other incentives, and\nas soon as a more attractive benefit or financially-appealing job appears on the\nhorizon, they will simply change their job, leaving you behind. Instead of\nmotivating them you should try to inspire them.</p>\n<p>So you may wonder how 1on1s might actually help here?</p>\n<p>Well, it depends how creative you are since 1on1s are a great place to convey\nwhatever message you would like to. While it might take a lot of courage to\nexpress your ideas in public you might find it more comfortable to do so in a\nface-to-face environment. Moreover, it’s applicable to employees as well: some of them would\nprefer to have a more in-depth discussion around some topics while others\nwould prefer to skim through the topics and quickly get through a lot of\nthem, rather than dig somewhat deeper. So even though you might have already announced\nsomething publicly to the company or team, you probably have just skimmed\nthrough the topics, slightly touching them but not getting into intricate\ndetails which part of the team might have expected.</p>\n<p>To sum up, commitment is not something that you can buy - it’s something\nthat you have to earn. The onus here is on the leader.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"1on1s part 2, Why run them?","date":"March 05, 2019","description":"This time the focus is on why we should even bother running meetings like that.
