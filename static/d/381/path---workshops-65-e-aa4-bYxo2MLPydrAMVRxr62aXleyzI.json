It allows to setup from zero to\nrunning app on a device in minutes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Props, state</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The basics of React are all about these too. Props allow to compose components\nby sending from parents to children:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\">  <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> Text <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"react-native\"</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">ExampleComponent</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> text <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>Text</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n      </span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>text<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n    </span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>Text</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>And state gives components ability to control encapsulated data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forms and AsyncStorage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forms are bread nad butter of every frontend developer so it makes sense to\npresent the idiomatic way of writing them in React Native. This was the place\nwhere we used the power of state for the purpose of saving inputs on each\nkeystroke and then push it to AsyncStorage on form submit.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\">  <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> AsyncStorage <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react-native'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> AsyncStorage<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">setItem</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'form'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> form<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> form <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> AsyncStorage<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getItem</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'form'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>AsyncStorage is not the perfect solution for this case, yet the API is pretty\nstraight forward and gives a lot of functionality without much boilerplate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigation through an app</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or how a web developer would call it <code class=\"language-text\">routing</code>. With React-navigation you set up routing almost as you would do it on web.\nSet of screens that you access via navigation to an established route. </p>\n<h4 id=\"what-ive-noticed\"><a href=\"#what-ive-noticed\" aria-label=\"what ive noticed permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What I’ve noticed</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Whether you like it or not pair programming is simply an effective way of\nsolving a couple of software development problems by: </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>boosting Distribution of knowledge. Diminish a number of bottlenecks in the\norganization by encourage other people to sit together and share their knowledge\nand work on solutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alleviate communication bias. Real time meetings, especially when you see other\npeople, are way more dynamic and allow you to express more with less words. Even\nthough your wording might not be as specific as if you wrote them, you have\nability of to express by gestures and intonation, which can convey emotions.\nDoubt, apprehension, excitement or cheer just to name a few. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tights up a feedback loop. You don’t wait 2 days after you finished development\nto get a corrective feedback which then forces you to redesign the solution. And\nthen you think that the worst thing here is that the new solution is simple\nbetter, if only you got it earlier…</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How many things you can do when you are passionate and curious. Mr obvious\nstrikes again, I know, but it hammered home to me during the last workshops. The\ntask given to people are mostly far from being mundane and obvious to\nparticipants.</p>\n<p>Also, there are many things I thought I’d known before I was asked to explain\nthem in detail, like aforementioned difference between div and Text, or\nintricate details about Expo </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Workshops","date":"March 01, 2019","description":"Running workshops"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/workshops/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/react-vs-react-native/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"React vs React Native"}}}}
