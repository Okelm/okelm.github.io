This is the first blog post here, I just wanted to say hello and post some information about me.

I'm a Software Developer, Frontend & Mobile Creator, Team Leader, father and husband.

I help to build software products and services from the ground up, particularly Android and iOS native or React Native apps and frontend apps in React. I also specialize in:

- building teams from scratch or mentoring and introducing existing teams to the world of React/React Native
- building processes, establishing CI/CD for mobiles
- app deployment in general
