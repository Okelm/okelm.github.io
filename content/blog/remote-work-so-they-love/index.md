Remote work gains in popularity year by year. It's definitely the global trend that has been enabled by the Internet and allows to provide you expertise to any part of the world. While it definitely gave the possibility to freely exchange resources, it also comes with some obstacles that makes the implementation hard:
* time zones
* native languages
* different culture
* various communication biases

I will try to address all the issues.

### Adjust your working time to the office hours

If the time difference is 6h, as in the case of Poland and New York, USA, it is advised to work afternoons (sometimes it’s a condition). You want to be able to work at least 3–4 hours within the other time zone. I recommend using [this tool](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/) to visualize the difference.

Usually it’s time to do meetings, demos, code reviews, pair programming, but if you’re in minority it might happen that the meetings would take place at evenings and then you might end up having meetings at around 9pm or so.

### Try to have pair programming sessions as if you were in the office

There are dozens benefits of programming in pairs (or more)

Plan pair programming session ahead. It might not be align with the engineering culture in some companies though, so don’t panic if somebody looks at you like you were a weirdo. Be the first one how makes screen sharing and show that you’re open to suggestion. 

You definitely need a good tooling to run an effective session. If you’re using [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you’ll need [Live Sharing](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share) plugin. It will simulate the one keyboard shared between two or more software developers.

### Set high standard of communication even if nobody expects it
(ZDJĘCIA!!!)
That’s one of the biggest obstacle to overcome in remote work. Nothing replaces the face to face interaction, but on the other hand the engineers usually don’t enjoy working in groups side by side and so its not always a bad thing. Anyway, there are a couple of things we can do address the communication overhead.

1.  Invest in top quality communication tools

Spend $149 and buy a good microphone like[ Blue Yeti](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Silver/dp/B002VA464S). You will be heard loud and clean, literally and figuratively.

Spend $125 on a [webcam](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c930e-webcam). 

At this point you have a good setup for being heard and seen.

2. Be on time on meetings

Being late on meetings is disrespecful. You want to be a couple of minutes before a meeting starts, yet it  really depends on the company culture what “on time” means, but before you learn it, it’s better to simply stick to that rule. 

3. Async communication is great, but don’t overestimate it

While most of the communication will be done via asynchronous channels, sometimes it’s worth jumping on a call and discuss an issue without the need to write and read again and again. If you’re worried that you will lose the benefit of having the conversation written down somewhere — no worries you can record the dialog!

### Encourage the team to record meetings

Especially these where somebody gives an intruction or introduction to a new tool or shares knowledge. Nobody can memorize the step by step instruction like this: [https://youtu.be/Xh2nnjttOwo](https://youtu.be/Xh2nnjttOwo)

You would rather record it and publish within the company and let people get back to it when they are in need. If you work remotely you might be the one how will use it first.

### Raise visibility by staying transparent 

On the whole, you should try using the tooling provided by the team and in the most cases it will be comprise with project management platforms, source code repos and communication channels.

In my opinion in most cases you’ll be just fine with using what other team members use. Some exceptions depend on how your role is different from the most roles in the team.

**If you’re the first remote guy in the team**, you should think of being proactive in staying visible with what you do. If you get hired as the first remote guy ever, you’re definitely an expert and you’re the one who is expected to create an effective mean of collaboration.

**If you’re not the first one, but your time zone is very different** from the rest of the team, and you work mostly in your time zone, you must be causious since the good practices within the team might be not enough in your case. You will communicate mostly async, so you should place a lot of importance on setting high standard to raise visibility. 

Regardless of your situation there is a piece of advice on that:
**Divide work to smaller chunks that you can deliver daily. Describe the job that is done by the desciptive pull/merge reguest message with video or gifs and by small and self-explanatory commits.**

### We are all different 

It's a business's vested interest to hire the most qualified ones irrespective of differences. It should go without saying and it indeed does in the great numbers of IT companies, some includes the following information to clarify though:    

*We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are ADA compliant and handicap accessible.*

Whether it's honest and a company really commit to it is anybody's guess, but you should definitely stay fair. 

**This is one of the greatest advantage of highly competitive markets. It supports an expertise and doesn't give a damn about your personal traits, which are meaningless from business perspective.**

### Be aware of the differences in culture

When you work remotely for a company located in a different country it's almost as if you really were there. **You must read up on their customs.** 

[**Hofstede Insights**](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/product/compare-countries/) has been trying to categorize differences between cultures into groups and connect these groups with countries for a long time now. Even though they compare countries, I believe they should rather focus on comparing cultures themselves. Nevertheless, some conclusions hit home and it's worth checking out. 

[These are all very influential factors](http://localhost:8000/remote-work-so-they-love/#hofstede-categories-in-detail) that may work for you if you handle them wisely, but they can also take you aback if you underestimate their influence. 

#### Let's compare!
![https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/norway,poland,the-usa/](./compare.png)

Take [Poland, Norway and United States](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/norway,poland,the-usa/) as an example, and **have some fun comparing them and focusing on Poland**:

![](./fun.gif)

*Relatively high Distance to power and quite low Individualism is definitely what I would expected to clearly visible in the Polish society now. Hell yeah, whether it's the influence of years of occupation, wars and socialism I don't know, but Poles in general are keen to accept authorities (if it's polish, heh).*

*We are all men, and high Masculinity expresses it, that is, being result driven rather than having fun at work. Even women are men. They must be in order to survive here. I mean, they must be competitive, we all must be. Nobody will pay you just for being special or different.*

*Uncertainty Avoidance scored almost 100%... "But what is Uncertainty" a pole may ask you one day. "I haven't met any in my entire life!". Totally, most poles are satisfied with stable 9-5 job, spend their entire life in the same place, apartment or house.*

*By and large Poles are long-term oriented and are quite restraint when it comes to allowing for some enjoyment in their lifes. Omg they must be boring as hell! (it is)*

Even though I don't fit to the generalized version of a polish guy, I must agree that I was raised within such society. I feel, however, that I had recognized these traits and intentionally ditch these, which I don't accept

 Knowing your own environment is one thing, and it will help you, but there are even more benefits if you open to other coworkers' cultures and believes. You will understand that some of them are just part of their identity and cannot be fight back or alter. Their should be rather understand and some work towards accepting might do wonders for your relationships.

 #### Hofstede categories in detail:

 Let's look at all of the categories:
1. **Distance to power**: The extent to which people accepts differences between each other, particular in the field of power, income and influence. The bigger the distance, the more probable that individuals will accept the established hierarchy. This approach may very well hamper innovation and stop down-top communication leaving organizations without any feedback and initiative which "normally" would be expected from employees. Normally means various things depending on culture. And that's the beauty! We are different, but we must first notice it, and then understand consequenses.

2. **Individualism**: It's self-explanatory, the opposite is collectivism. People with more indiviualist traits are more focused on their own goals, they are driven by their own beliefs (however crazy they might be) and less depended on communities or groups. It might be hard for them to play in a team and follow team's goals.

3. **Masculinity**: the more masculine a society, the more success driven it is. Hence less important is to do what you like and rather focus on things that bring you success, whether it's fame, wealth or respect.

4. **Uncertainty Avoidance**: societies with high scores are more open to novelties and innovation, also they are better at managing changing environment. But it comes with the risk tasking approach which might not be desirable in some cases.

5. **Long Term Orientation** and **Indulgance**: savings, education, taking care of relationships, all of them are traits related to long term orientation. Whereas Indulgance is related to the extent individuals are keen to allow themselves to do what their instincts tells them. They are less **Restraint**, which is said to be the opposite.

### Sum up

While very attractive and beneficial, remote work comes with some obstacles. Handle them properly and you will be able to focus only on benefits and forget about problems. 

Care about communication, stay visible when it comes to how the job is going and, last but not least, embrace the diversity.

I hope you will be fine with the piece of advice I gave you. I constanlty learning how to work remotely, both by  working remotely within teams and building and running new teams from time to time. If you have any suggestions I would appreciate any feedback.
