### A piece of advice

#### For leaders

Introducing one on one meetings is rather an evolutionary process than a
revolution. It takes some time to make people comfortable and gain their
involvement. When you first invite somebody to a meeting, the message should be
clear — it’s for us to talk. And the first meeting should be exactly as that.

You may say that it’s easier to say than do. Well, while it’s definitely easier
to introduce the meetings when you have just joined a new team and everything
around you is fresh, it might be terribly hard for those who have already built
a relationship with people, and now wants to introduce a mysterious new thing.
It’s up to them whether the benefits outweigh the loses, yet this post strongly
encourages to place a great deal of importance on face-to-face relationships.

#### For those who were invited

Calm down. If you get an invitation your career is probably on the verge of
getting better, short of you have been conspicuously sloppy, aggressive or
obnoxious in any way.

### Summary

To summarize, even though it takes some doing it’s worth devoting your time to
introduce the convention of running one on one meetings regularly:

1.  Leaders are responsible for running then, not HR people,
1.  It’s not a place to discuss an issue which should be addressed through public
channels,
1.  There are at least three main reasons why to run the meetings. The one is that
is that is if you know for receiving feedback from people. The second is it’s a
way for leaders to provide mentorship. The third it’s a convenient way to
identify employees problems,

Even though I mainly draw on my own experience, my knowledge is based on
resources that I strongly recommend:
